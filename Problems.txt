1. The benchmarks.py is not clear, as it seems that there is a mixture between old and new configurations.
   Therefore, it is not clear whether some of these files are required (e.g., merged_xray.xes)

2. Hybrid provides datasets containing nan values. Temporally fixed this by going as follows:
   - replacing all the X values with nan with zeros
   - removing all the data rows having nan values in Y

   This, in some cases, seems to favour the results

3. There is no script to convert the .txt files to the csv-s required to plot the charts in the Notebooks in DataVisualization
